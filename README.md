# Docker
Docker from scratch

Terminologies: 
1> Docker is not a virtual machine. It's all about isolation. 
2> Image : It is a class definition
3> Container: It's a running image. It's an object created from the class (image)/ instance of a class.
4> Host: It's the machine which docker is running. If on a windows machine , we are running docker on a linux container then Windows is the host.
